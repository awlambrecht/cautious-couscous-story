Alright, so one time there was a guy named Daniel, and he wanted to marry his girlfriend, April. He travelled all over the world with April, and decided that she was the one. One evening a terrible storm prevented daniel from taking his ususal route home. He decided to take the country roads home, which turned out to be a fatal mistake. The roads were really slick as the rain was pouring down. Thunder and lightning were lighting up the sky. All of a sudden, a lightning strike comes down hitting a tree. 
	The tree fell just as Daniel's car past it. With a sigh of relief Daniel realized how fortunate he was. He continued on his route home, but started to reflecton his life up until now. When he reached home, he parked in his driveway and realized that a different tree had fallen through the roof of his house. 
"Just my luck," Daniel thought. He inspected the damages and wondered if his insurance would be able to cover this. He gasped when he noticed the worst part of the damage - the tree had fallen over his bedroom closet, ruining the tuxedo he planned on wearing to his wedding.
